<h3>Great Depression</h3>

<br />
<h3>By: James Example </h3>
<br />
<p>
The Great Depression was a worldwide economic downturn that started in 1929 and lasted for about a decade. It began in the United States after the stock market crash on October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday. People were investing a lot of money in stocks, hoping their prices would keep rising. But when stock prices suddenly dropped, many lost everything. Banks went bankrupt, and businesses shut down, leading to high unemployment. At the peak of the Depression, around 25% of Americans were unemployed.

The effects of the Great Depression were felt all over the world, and countries like Germany, Britain, and France also experienced severe economic troubles. People struggled to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and clothing. Many families were forced to move from their homes in search of work, and some even built makeshift homes from scrap materials, known as "Hoovervilles," after President Herbert Hoover, who was blamed for not doing enough to stop the crisis.
</p><p>
The government took steps to help people recover. President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, a series of programs aimed at creating jobs, providing relief, and reforming the financial system. For example, the Social Security Act was passed to help people who were elderly, sick, or unemployed. Roosevelt also established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent future crashes.

In recent years, experts have learned more about how the Great Depression was caused by a combination of factors, including poor banking practices, an unstable stock market, and reduced international trade. Some also argue that the way the U.S. responded helped the economy recover faster than if no action had been taken. Modern economists emphasize that government intervention, like Roosevelt's programs, played a crucial role in helping the economy bounce back.
</p><p>
Today, the lessons of the Great Depression still influence economic policies around the world. Experts suggest that in times of crisis, it's important for governments to step in and help people, especially when unemployment and poverty rise to dangerous levels. The Great Depression reminds us how important it is to have a stable financial system and support for the most vulnerable in society.
