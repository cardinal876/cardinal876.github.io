Atoms consist of a nucleus, made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus determines what element the atom represents. For example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, while an atom with 79 protons is gold. Atoms bond together to form molecules, which make up all substances." },
  { id: 2, title: "Photon", content: "author needed", url: "result1006.html", description2: "A photon is a particle of light. Light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation, travels in the form of photons. Unlike objects we can see, photons don’t have mass, but they carry energy and move at the speed of light. Photons have both particle-like and wave-like properties, which is a concept known as wave-particle duality. They are essential for understanding phenomena like the photoelectric effect, where light knocks electrons off a surface." },
  { id: 3, title: "Electron", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "An electron is a negatively charged particle that orbits the nucleus of an atom. Electrons are much smaller than protons and neutrons and are essential in chemistry because their arrangement determines how atoms interact. Electrons can move between different energy levels or orbitals around the nucleus, and when they do, they release or absorb energy. Electrons play a major role in electricity, magnetism, and chemical reactions." },
  { id: 4, title: "Proton", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of every atom. Protons are much heavier than electrons and play a crucial role in determining the identity of an element. For example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, while an atom with 79 protons is gold. The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is called its atomic number, and it also influences the atom’s chemical properties." },
  { id: 5, title: "Neutron", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "A neutron is a neutral particle (with no charge) that resides in the nucleus of an atom, along with protons. Neutrons are slightly heavier than protons, but they don’t affect the charge of an atom. However, they play an important role in the atom’s stability. For example, some atoms have more neutrons than protons, which makes them isotopes of the same element. Neutrons also play a role in nuclear reactions, such as those in the Sun." },

There are six types, or 'flavors', of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Protons and neutrons are made of up and down quarks, while other particles are made of combinations of different quarks. Quarks are held together by a force called the strong force, which is carried by particles called gluons." },
  { id: 7, title: "Gluon", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "A gluon is a particle that carries the strong nuclear force. This is the force that holds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Gluons also hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. The strong force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, and gluons are what mediate it, allowing quarks to stay bound tightly inside larger particles." },
  { id: 8, title: "Boson", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "A boson is a type of particle that obeys Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlike fermions, which follow the Pauli exclusion principle (meaning no two fermions can occupy the same state), bosons can occupy the same space and energy state. Some bosons, like the photon, are force carriers, meaning they mediate fundamental forces in the universe. The Higgs boson, for example, is thought to give other particles mass." },
  { id: 9, title: "Fermion", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Fermions are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time.

Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions, such as those that occur in the Sun. Despite their abundance (there are trillions passing through us every second), neutrinos are very difficult to detect because they rarely interact with anything. They are important for understanding processes like nuclear fusion and the behavior of supernovae." },

It exists in many forms, including kinetic energy (the energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), thermal energy (heat), and electrical energy (energy from the movement of charged particles). Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This is known as the law of conservation of energy." },
  { id: 12, title: "Momentum", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop a moving object. It is the product of an object’s mass and its velocity. The greater an object’s mass or velocity, the greater its momentum. Momentum is conserved in isolated systems, meaning that the total momentum before and after an event like a collision remains the same." },

  { id: 14, title: "Mass", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It also determines the strength of an object’s gravitational attraction. Mass is different from weight, as weight depends on gravity and changes with location, while mass remains constant. An object with more mass has more inertia, which is the resistance to changes in motion." },
  { id: 15, title: "Charge", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Charge is a property of particles that causes them to experience a force in an electric field. There are two types of charge: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract. Protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge. Electric charge is quantized, meaning it comes in discrete amounts." },
  { id: 16, title: "Spin", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Spin is a property of particles that describes their intrinsic angular momentum. It’s a quantum property, which means it doesn’t directly correspond to spinning in space like a top. Instead, spin is more about the way particles interact with magnetic fields. Some particles, like electrons, have spin 1/2, which gives them a property known as 'half-integer spin'. Other particles, like photons, have integer spins, which are important in how they behave as bosons." },

Visible light, for example, has wavelengths between about 400 and 700 nanometers, which is what our eyes can detect." },
  { id: 25, title: "Wave-Particle Duality", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Wave-particle duality is a concept from quantum mechanics that states that every particle or quantum entity can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This is particularly evident in light, which behaves as both a wave and a particle. For example, light can interfere with itself (like waves) but can also be absorbed by electrons (like particles). This concept challenges our classical understanding of physics and is one of the key ideas in quantum mechanics." },
   { id: 26, title: "Superconductivity", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "Superconductivity is a phenomenon that occurs when certain materials are cooled below a critical temperature, causing them to have zero electrical resistance. This allows electric current to flow without any energy loss, making superconductors highly efficient.

In the experiment, a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom that may decay or not. If the atom decays, a poison is released, killing the cat. If it does not decay, the cat remains alive. According to quantum mechanics, until the box is opened and observed, the cat is both alive and dead, demonstrating the strangeness of superposition." },

Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. The boundary of a black hole is called the event horizon, and once an object crosses it, it cannot escape. Black holes are studied in the field of general relativity and are important for understanding extreme gravity and spacetime." },
  { id: 35, title: "Event Horizon", content: "author needed", url: "", description2: "The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. Once something passes the event horizon, it is considered to be inside the black hole. The event horizon marks the point at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, and anything that crosses it will inevitably be drawn into the singularity at the center of the black hole." },

It is theorized to exist at the center of black holes, where matter is thought to collapse into a single point with zero volume and infinite density. At this point, the laws of physics as we know them break down, and general relativity and quantum mechanics need to be reconciled." },
