  { id: 2, title: "Vaccination", content: "Vaccination, from Latin vacca, a cow, the term originally devised for a method of protective inoculation against smallpox, consisting in the intentional transference to the human being of the eruptive disease of cattle called cow-pox ( In applying to cow-pox the term “variolae vaccinae,Jenner gave expression to his belief that this disease was inreality nothing more nor less than small-pox of thecow. But soon it was discovered that if there weresuch a malady as “small-pox of the cow,” therewas also, as Dr Loy first satisfactorily demonstrated,a small-pox of the horse, which, under the name of“grease,” was resorted to from time to time as a sourceof vaccine lymph. Jenner had, indeed, put forward thesuggestion that “grease” was a necessary antecedent to cowpox;but even taking this term to have been used by him inthe sense of horse-pox, he was, in all probability, mistakenin his assumption. At the same time, however, there can belittle doubt that these two diseases are very closely allied,if indeed they be not identical. As evidence of a definiterelationship between human small-pox and cow-pox, it maybe mentioned that whereas, prior to the introduction of vaccination, epidemics of these disorders frequently arose concurrently,the so-called “natural” cow-pox has now in greatmeasure disappeared. There is, moreover, no appreciabledifference in the minute anatomical appearances characteristicof the eruption following on inoculation of one or other of thesetwo affections in the human subject. But of far greater importancein this connexion are the results obtained by numerousobservers who, in various parts of the world, and almost fromthe time of lenner onwards, have set themselves the task ofattempting, by experimental methods, to solve the problemof the true relationship of variola to vaccinia. As the outcomeof this work it may now be definitely stated that small-poxlymph, more especially, as the present writer has shown, ifobtained from the primary vesicle of a case of the inoculatedform of the disease, by passage through the system of the calfcan be so altered in character as to become deprived of itspower of causing a generalized eruption, while inducing at thesite of inoculation a vesicle indistinguishable from a typicalvaccine vesicle; and, more important still, that when transferredagain to man, it has by such treatment completely lostits former infectious character. Such being the case, it mayfairly be asserted that cow-pox, or rather that artificiallyinoculated form of the disease which we term , is nothingmore nor less than  modified by transmission throughthe bovine animal. An outbreak of small-pox, indeed, maybe turned to account for raising, by appropriate experimentalmethods, a fresh stock of vaccine lymph.There is much evidence to prove that the results followingon vaccination are due to a specific contagium, and, moreover,that the particular micro-organism concerned is capableof existing, during one period of its life-cycle, in aresting or spore form, in which condition it is moreresistant to the germicidal effects of glycerin than is the casewith non-sporing microbes. Advantage is taken of this fact,in the method devised by the present writer, and now -employedofficially in England, as also on the Continent and in America,for ensuring the bacteriological purity of vaccine lymph. Upto the present, unfortunately, no satisfactory method hasbeen discovered by which the micro-organism of vacciniacan be unfailingly cultivated on artificial media while stillretaining its specific properties.The clinical activity and bacteriological purity of the lymphemployed for vaccination; the skilful performance of theoperation itself; the making an adequate numberof insertions of lymph over a sufficient area; theobservance of precautions needful for ensuring strictasepsis, both at the time of vaccination and subsequentlyuntil the vaccination wounds are soundly healed—all theseare matters to be regarded as essential to “efficient vaccination.” Certain principles in respect of them are generally recognized, and in the case of public vaccinators, whose work comes under government inspection, a series of instructions on these several points are prescribed by the Local Government Board. First in regard to lymph. That which is now almost universally employed in Great Britain is glycerinated cali lymph, the use of which has entirely superseded, in public vaccinations, the arm-to-arm method which for many years previously had been employed as the best means then attainable of ensuring the activity and comparative purity of the lymph.Glycerinated lymph, under proper conditions, usually retainsits potency for many weeks or months; but nevertheless, incertain circumstances at present imperfectly understood, is liableto become gradually weakened, and even eventually to becomealtogether inert. Possibly the condition of the calves from whichthe lymph is obtained, especially as regards their general healthand the suppleness or the reverse of their skins, or exposureof the lymph to the action of light or to a high temperature,are of special importance. Consequently, in order to ensurethe best results from its use, it is not only necessary that great care should be exercised in its manufacture, but it is also advisable that the lymph should be employed for vaccination as soon as possible after bacteriological examination has demonstrated its freedom from suppurative and other extraneous microorganisms. As regards the carrying out of the operation itself, it is somewhat unfortunate that there exists no official definition of what constitutes a “successful vaccination,” and in consequence it is open to any practitioner to give a certificate of successful vaccination in cases where but one minute vesicle may have been produced. It is to be feared that such certificates are too frequently given, and it cannot be too strongly urged that vaccination of this sort involves incomplete protection. The standard laid down by the Local Government Board—the production, namely, of a total area of vesiculation of not less than half a square inch, divided among four separate vesicles or groups of vesicles, not less than half an inch from one another has for the most part proved easily attainable in practice, and it is much to be desired that in private as in public work the attainment of this standard should be aimed at in every instance.The protection afforded by a primary vaccination tendsgradually to diminish, and eventually to disappear more orless completely, with the lapse of time. In consequence, it isdesirable that the operation should be repeated at the age offrom seven to ten years, and thereafter, if it be possible, atintervals during later life. The final report of the RoyalCommission thus summarizes the evidence as to the value ofsuch additional procedure:-“Where re-vaccinated persons were attacked by, or died from,small-pox, the re-vaccination had for the most part been performed a considerable number of years before the attack. There were veryfew cases where a short period only had elapsed between the re vaccinationand the attack of small-pox. This seems to show thatit is of importance, in the case of any persons specially exposed tothe risk of contagion, that they should be re-vaccinated, and thatin the case even of those who have been twice re-vaccinated withsuccess, if a long interval since the last operation has elapsed, theoperation should be repeated for a third, and even a fourth time.It not infrequently happens that in the case of a re-vaccinationthe process runs a somewhat different course from that witnessedin a typical primary vaccination. In a successful re-vaccination,the site of the operation may be distinctly reddened and somewhatirritable by the second day, while papules will probablymake their appearance about the third to the fifth day. Thepapules may or may not develop further into vesicles andpustules. Occasionally a re-vaccination appears to fail altogether;but, as pointed out by the Royal Commission,it is advisable, as in the case of a primary vaccination, to makefurther attempts with lymph of known potency before concludingthat the individual is really insusceptible.In a certain small proportion of cases the operation ofvaccination has been followed, after a longer or shorter interval, by various complications, of which by far thelnlurious most important are those of an inflammatory nature,such as erysipelas, which are not peculiar to vaccination,but which constitute the danger of any local lesionof the skin, however caused. During the many decades inwhich vaccination from arm to arm was practised, in manymillions of children, a few authenticated cases were recordedin which there was reason to believe that syphilis could havebeen in vaccinated. Such an occurrence could at no time havehappened if proper care had been taken by the vaccinator;and now that the use of calf lymph has become practicallyuniversal, the possibility of such occurrence in the futuremay be disregarded, since the calf is not capable of contractingthis disease. Tubercle in its Various forms and leprosy havealso been included in the list of possible complications ofvaccination, though without any sufficient proof. The employmentof calf lymph, treated with glycerin after the mannerfirst advocated by S. Monckton Copeman, will obviate anysuch danger, for even if tubercle bacilli or the Streptococcus oferysipelas were by chance present in the lymph material whencollected, it has been found experimentally that they are quiteunable to survive prolonged exposure to the action of a 50%solution of glycerin in water. Leprosy is not 'communicableto the calf. In view of the frequency of various skin eruptionsin infancy, it is to be expected that in a proportion of cases theywill appear during the weeks following vaccination. Eczemabeen attributed tobetween the operation and the occurrenceIn section 434 of the final report of theon Vaccination the extent to which otherare liable to complicate vaccination is thus summed up:—“A careful examination of the facts which have been broughtunder our notice has enabled us to arrive at the conclusion thatalthough some of the dangers said to attend vaccination are undoubtedlyreal, and not inconsiderable in gross amount, yet whenconsidered in relation to the extent of vaccination work done, theyare insignificant. There is reason, further, to believe that they arediminishing under the better precautions of the present day, andwith the additions of the future precautions which experiencesuggests, will do so still more in the future!

  { id: 1, title: "Indigo", content: "Indigo, earlier , the Indian substanceor dye, is one ofthe most important and valuable of all dyestuffs. Until comparativelyrecently it was obtained exclusively from the aqueousextract of certain plants, principally of the genus which belongs to the natural order Leguminosae. Smallquantities are also obtained from (west coast of Africa),  (China) and thewoad plant . The latter is of historical interest,since up to the middle of the 17th century it was the only bluedyestuff used by dyers in England and on the adjoining continent;at the present time woad is still cultivated in Europe, butserves merely as a ferment in the setting of the fermentationindigo vat or so-called woad vat used in wool dyeing.The bulk of the natural indigo which is brought into themarket comes from India, while smaller quantities are importedfrom Java, Guatemala and other places. The plant from whichindigo is made in Bengal is the , which isreared from seed sown about the end of April or the beginningof March. By the middle of June the plant has attained aheight of from 3 to 5 ft., and it is at this period that the firstmanufacturing begins, a second crop being obtained in August.The indigo is contained in the leaf of the plant in the form ofa colourless glucoside, known as indican, CO.This substance is soluble in water and by the joint action ofan enzyme, contained in the leaf, and atmospheric oxygen ityields indigotine, the colouring matter of indigo. It is on thesefacts that the manufacturing of indigo from the plant is based.The plant is cut early in the morning and transported to thefactory in bullock carts. Here it is steeped in water in steepingvats having a capacity of about 1000 cub. ft. for periods varying,according to circumstances, from nine to fourteen hours, whenthe liquid—the colour of which varies from a bright orange toan olive green—is run into the beating vats which lie at a lowerlevel. The beating, the object of which is to bring the liquoras freely as possible into contact with the air, was formerlydone by striking the surface with bamboo sticks, but is noweffected either by means of a paddle wheel or by forcing a currentof air from a steam blower or a compressor through the liquid.", url: "result1006.html", author: "Edmund Knecht, Ph.D", description2: "" },
