Indigo, earlier <i>indico</i>, from Lat. <i>indicum</i>, the Indian substance
or dye, is one of
the most important and valuable of all dyestuffs. Until comparatively
recently it was obtained exclusively from the aqueous
extract of certain plants, principally of the genus <i>Indigofera</i>
which belongs to the natural order Leguminosae. Small
quantities are also obtained from <i>Lonchocarpus eyanescens</i>
(west coast of Africa), <i>Polygonum tintorium</i> (China) and the
woad plant <i>Isatis tinctoria</i>. The latter is of historical interest,
since up to the middle of the 17th century it was the only blue
dyestuff used by dyers in England and on the adjoining continent;
at the present time woad is still cultivated in Europe, but
serves merely as a ferment in the setting of the fermentation
indigo vat or so-called “woad vat” used in wool dyeing.
</p><p>The bulk of the natural indigo which is brought into the
market comes from India, while smaller quantities are imported
from Java, Guatemala and other places. The plant from which
indigo is made in Bengal is the <i>Indigofera sumatrana</i>, which is
reared from seed sown about the end of April or the beginning
of March. By the middle of June the plant has attained a
height of from 3 to 5 ft., and it is at this period that the first
manufacturing begins, a second crop being obtained in August.
The indigo is contained in the leaf of the plant in the form of
a colourless glucoside, known as indican, C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>17</sub>O<sub>6</sub>N·3H<sub>2</sub>O.
This substance is soluble in water and by the joint action of
an enzyme, contained in the leaf, and atmospheric oxygen it
yields indigotine, the colouring matter of indigo. It is on these
facts that the manufacturing of indigo from the plant is based.
</p><p>The plant is cut early in the morning and transported to the
factory in bullock carts. Here it is steeped in water in steeping
vats having a capacity of about 1000 cub. ft. for periods varying,
according to circumstances, from nine to fourteen hours, when
the liquid—the colour of which varies from a bright orange to
an olive green—is run into the beating vats which lie at a lower
level. The beating, the object of which is to bring the liquor
as freely as possible into contact with the air, was formerly
done by striking the surface with bamboo sticks, but is now
effected either by means of a paddle wheel or by forcing a current
of air from a steam blower or a compressor through the liquid.
When the beating is finished, the precipitated indigo is allowed
to settle, the supernatant liquid being drawn off and run to
waste. The indigo mud thus obtained, which is known as mal,
is strained, boiled for a short period for the purpose of sterilizing,
formed into bars, cut into blocks of about 3 in. cube and dried.<sup id="cite_ref-f1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Indigo#cite_note-f1-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
The actual amount of colouring matter yielded by the leaf is
but small, averaging, according to Ch. Rawson, 0.5%, but the
yield from the whole plant is considerably less, since the stalks
and twigs contain practically no colour.
</p><p>Since the introduction on a large scale of synthetic indigo
efforts have been made in India and in Java to place the cultivation
of the plant and the manufacture of the natural product
on a more scientific basis. But although many important
improvements have been achieved from the agricultural as well
as from the manufacturing point of view, resulting no doubt
in the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from retension">retention</span> of a portion of the industry, the synthetic
product has gained the upper hand and is likely to retain it.
</p><p>Natural indigoes vary considerably in composition, containing
in some qualities as much as 90% and in others as little as 20%
of colouring matter. The blue colouring matter which indigo
contains is known as indigotine, but there are usually also present
in small quantities other colouring matters such as indigo red
or indirubrine, a yellow colour known as kaempferol, indigo
green and indigo brown, as well as indigo gluten and more or
less mineral matter.
</p><p>The bulk of the indigo which now comes into the European
market is prepared synthetically from coal tar. The following
figures indicate the values of the imports into England of
natural and synthetic indigo, and are taken from the official
Board of Trade returns:—

<p>During the period 1899–1908, the average price of indigo had
declined from a fraction under 3s. to about 2s. 2<span class="sfrac">⁠<span class="tion" style="font-size:61%;"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">2</span></span>⁠</span>d. per ℔. At
first sight it might appear that the use of indigo in England
was rapidly declining, but this does not necessarily follow when
it is borne in mind that London was formerly the distributing
centre of natural indigo for the continent and America.
