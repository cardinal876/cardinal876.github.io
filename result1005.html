<b>VACCINATION</b> (from Lat. <i>vacca</i>, a cow) [Date: 1911], the term originally devised for a method of protective inoculation against smallpox, consisting in the intentional transference to the human being of the eruptive disease of cattle called cow-pox (<i>vaccinia</i>). The discovery of vaccination is due to Dr Edward Jenner (<i>q.v.</i>), at the time a country medical practitioner of Berkeley, in the vale of Gloucester, whose investigations were first published in 1798 in the form of a pamphlet entitled An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, &amp;c. Many years previously, while he was an apprentice to a medical man at Sodbury, near Bristol, his attention was directed to a belief, widely prevalent in Gloucestershire during the latter half of the 18th century, that those persons who in the course of their employment on dairy farms happened to contract cow-pox were thereby protected from a subsequent attack of small-pox. In particular, his interest was aroused by a casual remark made by a young countrywoman who happened to come to the surgery one day for advice, and who; on hearing mention made of small-pox, immediately volunteered the statement that she could not take the disease, as she had had cow-pox. On coming up to London in 1770, to finish his medical education, Jenner became a pupil of John Hunter, with whom he frequently discussed the question of the possibility of obtaining protection against small-pox. On his return to his native village of Berkeley in 1773, to practise as a medical man, he took every opportunity of talking over and investigating the matter, but it was not until May 1796 that he actually began to make experiments. His first case of vaccination was that of a boy eight years of age, named James Phipps, whom he inoculated in the arm with cow-pox matter taken from a sore on the hand of Sarah Nelmes, a dairymaid, who had become infected with the disease by milking cows suffering from cowpox. It was apparently not until 1798 that he made his first attempt to carry on a strain of lymph from arm to arm. In the spring of that year he inoculated a child with matter taken directly from the nipple of a cow, and from the resulting vesicle on the arm of the child first Operated upon, he inoculated, or, as it may now be more correctly termed, "vaccinated," another. From this child several others were vaccinated. From one of these a fourth remove was successfully carried out, and finally a fifth. Four of these children were subsequently inoculated with small-pox— the “variolous test”—without result. The success of many such experiments, in his own hands and in those of his contemporaries, led Jenner to express his belief—"a mistaken one, as events have proved—that the protective influence of vaccination would be found to last throughout the lifetime of the person operated on. Obviously he did not realize the fact that the data at his disposal were insufficient for the formation of an accurate judgment on this point, since time alone could prove the exact duration of the protection originally obtained. Subsequent experience has demonstrated that, as has been well said by a writer in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, “even after efficient vaccination a slow progress away from safety and towards danger is inevitable, and re-vaccination at least once after childhood is necessary if protection is to be maintained.” <div class="__nop wst-nop"></div>

In applying to cow-pox the term “variolae vaccinae,"
Jenner gave expression to his belief that this disease was in
reality nothing more nor less than small-pox of the
cow. But soon it was discovered that if there were
such a malady as “small-pox of the cow,” there
was also, as Dr Loy first satisfactorily demonstrated,
a small-pox of the horse, which, under the name of
“grease,” was resorted to from time to time as a source
of vaccine lymph. Jenner had, indeed, put forward the
suggestion that “grease” was a necessary antecedent to cowpox;
but even taking this term to have been used by him in
the sense of horse-pox, he was, in all probability, mistaken
in his assumption. At the same time, however, there can be
little doubt that these two diseases are very closely allied,
if indeed they be not identical. As evidence of a definite
relationship between human small-pox and cow-pox, it may
be mentioned that whereas, prior to the introduction of vaccination, epidemics of these disorders frequently arose concurrently,
the so-called “natural” cow-pox has now in great
measure disappeared. There is, moreover, no appreciable
difference in the minute anatomical appearances characteristic
of the eruption following on inoculation of one or other of these
two affections in the human subject. But of far greater importance
in this connexion are the results obtained by numerous
observers who, in various parts of the world, and almost from
the time of lenner onwards, have set themselves the task of
attempting, by experimental methods, to solve the problem
of the true relationship of variola to vaccinia. As the outcome
of this work it may now be definitely stated that small-pox
lymph, more especially, as the present writer has shown, if
obtained from the primary vesicle of a case of the inoculated
form of the disease, by passage through the system of the calf
can be so altered in character as to become deprived of its
power of causing a generalized eruption, while inducing at the
site of inoculation a vesicle indistinguishable from a typical
vaccine vesicle; and, more important still, that when transferred
again to man, it has by such treatment completely lost
its former infectious character. Such being the case, it may
fairly be asserted that cow-pox, or rather that artificially
inoculated form of the disease which we term <i>vaccinia</i>, is nothing
more nor less than <i>variola</i> modified by transmission through
the bovine animal. An outbreak of small-pox, indeed, may
be turned to account for raising, by appropriate experimental
methods, a fresh stock of vaccine lymph.
</p>

<p>There is much evidence to prove that the results following
on vaccination are due to a specific contagium, and, moreover,
that the particular micro-organism concerned is capable
of existing, during one period of its life-cycle, in a
resting or spore form, in which condition it is more
resistant to the germicidal effects of glycerin than is the case
with non-sporing microbes. Advantage is taken of this fact,
in the method devised by the present writer, and now -employed
officially in England, as also on the Continent and in America,
for ensuring the bacteriological purity of vaccine lymph. Up
to the present, unfortunately, no satisfactory method has
been discovered by which the micro-organism of vaccinia
can be unfailingly cultivated on artificial media while still
retaining its specific properties.

<p>The publication in 1896 of the final report of the English Royal
Commission on Vaccination, in which the various phases of the
vaccination question are discussed on the basis of evidence
obtained from witnesses of all shades of opinion during
a period extending over no less than six years, considerably
simplifies the task of dealing with this subject. The
Royal Commission, originally numbering fifteen members,<sup id="cite_ref-832f1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Vaccination#cite_note-832f1-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
with Lord Herschell as president, was appointed in May 1889, the
terms of reference being as follows: “To inquire and report as to—(1)
The effect of vaccination in reducing the prevalence of, and mortality
from, small-pox. (2) What means, other than vaccination, can be
used for diminishing the prevalence of small-pox; and how far
such means could be relied on in place of vaccination. (3) The
objections made to vaccination on the ground of injurious effects
alleged to result therefrom; and the nature and extent of any
injurious effects which do, in fact, so result. (4) Whether any, and,
if so, what means should be adopted for preventing or lessening the
ill effects, if any, resulting from vaccination; and whether, and, if
so, by what means, vaccination with animal vaccine should be
further facilitated as a part of public vaccination. (5) Whether any
alterations should be made in the arrangements and proceedings
for securing the performance of vaccination, and, in particular,
in the provisions of the Vaccination Acts with respect to prosecutions
for non-compliance with the law.”
</p><p>The evidence given before the Royal Commission was published
at intervals in a series of Blue-books, but, as stated, it was not
until August 1896 that the final report made its appearance. As
regards the effect of vaccination in reducing the prevalence of, and
mortality from, small-pox, the following conclusions were arrived
at, Dr Collins and Mr Picton alone dissenting: “(1) That it
diminishes the liability to be attacked by the disease. (2) That it
modifies the character of the disease and renders it (<i>a</i>) less fatal,
and (<i>b</i>) of a milder or less severe type. (3) That the protection it
affords against attacks of the disease is greatest during the years
immediately succeeding the operation of vaccination. It is impossible
to fix with precision the length of this period of highest
protection. Though not in all cases the same, if a period is to be
fixed, it might, we think, fairly be said to cover in general a period
of nine or ten years. (4) That after the lapse of the period of
highest protective potency, the efficacy of vaccination to protect
against attack rapidly diminishes, but that it is still considerable
in the next quinquennium, and possibly never altogether ceases,
(5) That its power to modify the character of the disease is also
greatest in the period in which its power to protect from attack is
greatest, but that its power thus to modify the disease does not
diminish as rapidly as its protective influence against attacks, and
its efficacy, during the later periods of life, to modify the disease is
still very considerable. (6) That re-vaccination restores the protection
which lapse of time has diminished, but the evidence shows
that this protection again diminishes, and that, to ensure the
highest degree of protection which vaccination can give, the operation
should be at intervals repeated. (7) That the beneficial effects
of vaccination are most experienced by those in whose case it has
been most thorough. We think it may fairly be concluded that
where the vaccine matter is inserted in three or four places, it is
more effectual than when introduced into one or two places only,
and that if the vaccination marks are of an area of half a square
inch, they indicate a better state of protection than if their area be
at all considerably below this.”
</p><p>For the evidence, statistical or otherwise, on which these conclusions
are based, the Reports of the Royal Commission should be consulted.
But reference may here be made to two facts of which proof is
overwhelming. (1) Small-pox, in pre-vaccination days a disease
of infancy and childhood—like measles at the present day—has in
the United Kingdom become a disease mainly of adults. The
shifting of age-incidence can only be accounted for by the custom
of vaccination in infancy. To this day, when small-pox attacks
young unvaccinated children, it is found to be as virulent as, or
even more virulent than, small-pox in the unvaccinated at higher
ages. On the other hand, small-pox is practically unknown among
well-vaccinated children. When, quite exceptionally, such children
have been attacked, the disease has been so trivial in character as
to be liable to escape recognition altogether. (2) Medical men,
nurses and other persons exposed to the disease habitually protect
themselves by efficient re-vaccination, and when this precaution
has been taken, never contract small-pox.

<p>The clinical activity and bacteriological purity of the lymph
employed for vaccination; the skilful performance of the
operation itself; the making an adequate number
of insertions of lymph over a sufficient area; the
observance of precautions needful for ensuring strict
asepsis, both at the time of vaccination and subsequently
until the vaccination wounds are soundly healed—all these
are matters to be regarded as essential to “efficient vaccination.” Certain principles in respect of them are generally recognized, and in the case of public vaccinators, whose work comes under government inspection, a series of instructions on these several points are prescribed by the Local Government Board. First in regard to lymph. That which is now almost universally employed in Great Britain is glycerinated cali lymph, the use of which has entirely superseded, in public vaccinations, the arm-to-arm method which for many years previously had been employed as the best means then attainable <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="833" data-page-number="833" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 27.djvu/859" data-page-index="859" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_27.djvu/859"><span id="pageindex_859" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">​</span></span></span>
of ensuring the activity and comparative purity of the lymph.
Glycerinated lymph, under proper conditions, usually retains
its potency for many weeks or months; but nevertheless, in
certain circumstances at present imperfectly understood, is liable
to become gradually weakened, and even eventually to become
altogether inert. Possibly the condition of the calves from which
the lymph is obtained, especially as regards their general health
and the suppleness or the reverse of their skins, or exposure
of the lymph to the action of light or to a high temperature,
are of special importance. Consequently, in order to ensure
the best results from its use, it is not only necessary that great care should be exercised in its manufacture, but it is also advisable that the lymph should be employed for vaccination as soon as possible after bacteriological examination has demonstrated its freedom from suppurative and other extraneous microorganisms. As regards the carrying out of the operation itself, it is somewhat unfortunate that there exists no official definition of what constitutes a “successful vaccination,” and in consequence it is open to any practitioner to give a certificate of successful vaccination in cases where but one minute vesicle may have been produced. It is to be feared that such certificates are too frequently given, and it cannot be too strongly urged that vaccination of this sort involves incomplete protection. The standard laid down by the Local Government Board—the production, namely, of a total area of vesiculation of not less than half a square inch, divided among four separate vesicles or groups of vesicles, not less than half an inch from one another has for the most part proved easily attainable in practice, and it is much to be desired that in private as in public work the attainment of this standard should be aimed at in every instance.
</p><p>The protection afforded by a primary vaccination tends
gradually to diminish, and eventually to disappear more or
less completely, with the lapse of time. In consequence, it is
desirable that the operation should be repeated at the age of
from seven to ten years, and thereafter, if it be possible, at
intervals during later life. The final report of the Royal
Commission thus summarizes the evidence as to the value of
such additional procedure:-
</p><p>“Where re-vaccinated persons were attacked by, or died from,
small-pox, the re-vaccination had for the most part been performed a considerable number of years before the attack. There were very
few cases where a short period only had elapsed between the re vaccination
and the attack of small-pox. This seems to show that
it is of importance, in the case of any persons specially exposed to
the risk of contagion, that they should be re-vaccinated, and that
in the case even of those who have been twice re-vaccinated with
success, if a long interval since the last operation has elapsed, the
operation should be repeated for a third, and even a fourth time."
It not infrequently happens that in the case of a re-vaccination
the process runs a somewhat different course from that witnessed
in a typical primary vaccination. In a successful re-vaccination,
the site of the operation may be distinctly reddened and somewhat
irritable by the second day, while papules will probably
make their appearance about the third to the fifth day. The
papules may or may not develop further into vesicles and
pustules. Occasionally a re-vaccination appears to fail altogether;
but, as pointed out by the Royal Commission,
it is advisable, as in the case of a primary vaccination, to make
further attempts with lymph of known potency before concluding
that the individual is really insusceptible.
In a certain small proportion of cases the operation of
vaccination has been followed, after a longer or shorter interval, by various complications, of which by far the
lnlurious most important are those of an inflammatory nature,
such as erysipelas, which are not peculiar to vaccination,
but which constitute the danger of any local lesion
of the skin, however caused. During the many decades in
which vaccination from arm to arm was practised, in many
millions of children, a few authenticated cases were recorded
in which there was reason to believe that syphilis could have
been in vaccinated. Such an occurrence could at no time have
happened if proper care had been taken by the vaccinator;
and now that the use of calf lymph has become practically
universal, the possibility of such occurrence in the future
may be disregarded, since the calf is not capable of contracting
this disease. Tubercle in its Various forms and leprosy have
also been included in the list of possible complications of
vaccination, though without any sufficient proof. The employment
of calf lymph, treated with glycerin after the manner
first advocated by S. Monckton Copeman, will obviate any
such danger, for even if tubercle bacilli or the Streptococcus of
erysipelas were by chance present in the lymph material when
collected, it has been found experimentally that they are quite
unable to survive prolonged exposure to the action of a 50%
solution of glycerin in water. Leprosy is not 'communicable
to the calf. In view of the frequency of various skin eruptions
in infancy, it is to be expected that in a proportion of cases they
will appear during the weeks following vaccination. Eczema
been attributed to
between the operation and the occurrence
In section 434 of the final report of the
on Vaccination the extent to which other
are liable to complicate vaccination is thus summed up:—
</p><p>“A careful examination of the facts which have been brought
under our notice has enabled us to arrive at the conclusion that
although some of the dangers said to attend vaccination are undoubtedly
real, and not inconsiderable in gross amount, yet when
considered in relation to the extent of vaccination work done, they
are insignificant. There is reason, further, to believe that they are
diminishing under the better precautions of the present day, and
with the additions of the future precautions which experience
suggests, will do so still more in the future!"  (S. M. C.)
