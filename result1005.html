    <h1>The Great Depression</h1>
    <div class="author">By James Example</div>

    <p>
      The Great Depression was the most severe economic crisis of the twentieth century. Beginning in 1929 with the stock market crash in the United States, it quickly spread across the world, devastating economies, wiping out jobs, and creating widespread poverty. At its peak in the early 1930s, unemployment in the U.S. reached about 25%, while global trade fell by more than half.
    </p>

      Causes of the Depression remain a subject of study. Most scholars agree it was not caused by a single event, but by a combination of weak banking systems, overproduction, falling consumer demand, and failures of government policy. The collapse of banks played a particularly destructive role, as ordinary people lost their savings overnight. In response, governments introduced new protections like deposit insurance and stricter financial regulations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The New Deal, launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was a major turning point. It combined public works programs, social security, and banking reforms to stabilize the economy and provide relief. While not ending the Depression entirely, these measures reshaped the relationship between government and the economy in lasting ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent research has added nuance to our understanding. Economists now emphasize the role of international factors, such as the collapse of the global gold standard, which tied countries’ economies together and transmitted financial shocks worldwide. Others have studied how inequality before the Depression made societies more vulnerable to collapse. Modern comparisons are often drawn to the 2008 financial crisis, where rapid government intervention prevented a downturn of similar scale. Scholars today also highlight the long-term cultural effects: distrust of banks, changes in family life, and the growth of new political movements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Great Depression remains more than just a story of economic failure. It is a reminder of how fragile financial systems can be, and how policy choices—whether timid or bold—shape the lives of millions. Ongoing research into its causes and consequences helps us prepare for the challenges of today’s global economy, ensuring that history continues to inform the present.
