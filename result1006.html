    </p>

<p>Pieces of a certain highly esteemed iron ore, which consists
mainly of the oxide Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, are sometimes found to possess
the power of attracting small fragments of iron or steel. Ore
endowed with this curious property was well known to the ancient
Greeks and Romans, who, because it occurred plentifully
in the district of Magnesia near the Aegean coast, gave it
the name of <i>magnes</i>, or the <i>Magnesian stone</i>. In English-speaking
countries the ore is commonly known as <i>magnetite</i>,
and pieces which exhibit attraction as <i>magnets</i>; the cause to
which the attractive property is attributed is called <i>magnetism</i>,
a name also applied to the important branch of science which
has been evolved from the study of phenomena associated with
the magnet.
</p><p>If a magnet is dipped into a mass of iron filings and withdrawn,
filings cling to certain parts of the stone in moss-like
tufts, other parts remaining bare. There are generally two
regions where the tufts are thickest, and the attraction therefore
greatest, and between them is a zone in which no attraction is
evidenced. The regions of greatest attraction have received
the name of <i>poles</i>, and the line joining them is called the <i>axis</i>
of the magnet; the space around a magnet in which magnetic
effects are exhibited is called the <i>field of magnetic force</i>, or the
<i>magnetic field</i>.
</p><p>Up to the end of the 15th century only two magnetic phenomena
of importance, besides that of attraction, had been
observed. Upon one of these is based the principle of the
mariner’s compass, which is said to have been known to the
Chinese as early as 1100 <span class="wst-asc">B.C.</span>, though it was not introduced
into Europe until more than 2000 years later; a magnet
supported so that its axis is free to turn in a horizontal plane
will come to rest with its poles pointing approximately north
and south. The other phenomenon is mentioned by Greek
and Roman writers of the 1st century: a piece of iron, when
brought into contact with a magnet, or even held near one,
itself becomes “inductively” magnetized, and acquires the
power of lifting iron. If the iron is soft and fairly pure, it loses
its attractive property when removed from the neighbourhood
of the magnet; if it is hard, some of the induced magnetism
is permanently retained, and the piece becomes an artificial
magnet. Steel is much more retentive of magnetism than any
ordinary iron, and some form of steel is now always used for
making artificial magnets. Magnetism may be imparted to a
bar of hardened steel by stroking it several times from end to
 <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="322" data-page-number="322" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 17.djvu/337" data-page-index="337" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_17.djvu/337"><span id="pageindex_337" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">​</span></span></span> 
end, always in the same direction, with one of the poles of a
magnet. Until 1820 all the artificial magnets in practical use
derived their virtue, directly or indirectly, from the natural
magnets found in the earth: it is now recognized that the
source of all magnetism, not excepting that of the magnetic
ore itself, is electricity, and it is usual to have direct recourse
to electricity for producing magnetization, without the intermediary
of the magnetic ore. A wire carrying an electric
current is surrounded by a magnetic field, and if the wire is
bent into the form of an elongated coil or spiral, a field having
certain very useful qualities is generated in the interior. A bar
of soft iron introduced into the coil is at once magnetized, the
magnetism, however, disappearing almost completely as soon
as the current ceases to flow. Such a combination constitutes
an <i>electromagnet</i>, a valuable device by means of which a magnet
can be instantly made and unmade at will. With suitable
arrangements of iron and coil and a sufficiently strong current,
the intensity of the temporary magnetization may be very high,
and electromagnets capable of lifting weights of several tons
are in daily use in engineering works (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Electromagnetism" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Electromagnetism">Electromagnetism</a></span>).
If the bar inserted into the coil is of hardened steel instead of
iron, the magnetism will be less intense, but a larger proportion
of it will be retained after the current has been cut off. Steel
magnets of great strength and of any convenient form may be
prepared either in this manner or by treatment with an electromagnet;
hence the natural magnet, or <i>lodestone</i> as it is commonly
called, is no longer of any interest except as a scientific
curiosity.
</p><p>Some of the principal phenomena of magnetism may be
demonstrated with very little apparatus; much may be done
with a small bar-magnet, a pocket compass and a few ounces
of iron filings. Steel articles, such as knitting or sewing needles
and pieces of flat spring, may be readily magnetized by stroking
them with the bar-magnet; after having produced magnetism
in any number of other bodies, the magnet will have lost nothing
of its own virtue. The compass needle is a little steel magnet
balanced upon a pivot; one end of the needle, which always
bears a distinguishing mark, points approximately, but not in
general exactly, to the north,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Magnetism#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> the vertical plane through the
direction of the needle being termed the <i>magnetic meridian</i>.
The bar-magnet, if suspended horizontally in a paper stirrup
by a thread of unspun silk, will also come to rest in the magnetic
meridian with its marked end pointing northwards. The
north-seeking end of a magnet is in English-speaking countries
called the <i>north pole</i> and the other end the <i>south pole</i>; in France
the names are interchanged. If one pole of the bar-magnet
is brought near the compass, it will attract the opposite pole
of the compass-needle; and the magnetic action will not be
sensibly affected by the interposition between the bar and the
compass of any substance whatever except iron or other magnetizable
metal. The poles of a piece of magnetized steel may
be at once distinguished if the two ends are successively presented
to the compass; that end which attracts the south pole
of the compass needle (and is therefore north) may be marked
for easy identification.
</p><p>Similar magnetic poles are not merely indifferent to each
other, but exhibit actual repulsion. This can be more easily
shown if the compass is replaced by a magnetized knitting
needle, supported horizontally by a thread. The north pole
of the bar-magnet will repel the north pole of the suspended
needle, and there will likewise be repulsion between the two
south poles. Such experiments as these demonstrate the
fundamental law that <i>like poles repel each other</i>; <i>unlike poles</i>
<i>attract</i>. It follows that between two neighbouring magnets,
the poles of which are regarded as centres of force, there must
always be four forces in action. Denoting the two pairs of
magnetic poles by N, S and N′, S′, there is attraction between
N and S′, and between S and N′; repulsion between N and N′,
and between S and S′. Hence it is not very easy to determine
experimentally the law of magnetic force between poles. The
difficulty was overcome by C. A. Coulomb, who by using very
long and thin magnets, so arranged that the action of their
distant poles was negligible, succeeded in establishing the law,
which has since been confirmed by more accurate methods,
that <i>the force of attraction or repulsion exerted between two magnetic</i>
<i>poles varies inversely as the square of the distance between them</i>.
Since the poles of different magnets differ in strength, it is
important to agree upon a definite unit or standard of reference
in terms of which the strength of a pole may be numerically
specified. According to the recognized convention, the unit
pole is that which acts upon an equal pole at unit distance
with unit force: a north pole is reckoned as positive (+) and
a south pole as negative (−). Other conditions remaining
unchanged, the force between two poles is proportional to the
product of their strengths; it is repulsive or attractive according
as the signs of the poles are like or unlike.
</p><p>If a wire of soft iron is substituted for the suspended magnetic
needle, either pole of the bar-magnet will attract either end of
the wire indifferently. The wire will in fact become temporarily
magnetized by induction, that end of it which is nearest to the
pole of the magnet acquiring opposite polarity, and behaving
as if it were the pole of a permanent magnet. Even a permanent
magnet is susceptible of induction, its polarity becoming thereby
strengthened, weakened, or possibly reversed. If one pole of a
strong magnet is presented to the like pole of a weaker one,
there will be repulsion so long as the two are separated by a
certain minimum distance. At shorter distances the magnetism
induced in the weaker magnet will be stronger than its permanent
magnetism, and there will be attraction; two magnets with
their like poles in actual contact will always cling together unless
the like poles are of exactly equal strength. Induction is an
effect of the field of force associated with a magnet. Magnetic
force has not merely the property of acting upon magnetic
poles, it has the additional property of producing a phenomenon
known as <i>magnetic induction</i>, or <i>magnetic flux</i>, a physical condition
which is of the nature of a flow continuously circulating
through the magnet and the space outside it. Inside the magnet
the course of the flow is from the south pole to the north pole;
thence it diverges through the surrounding space, and again
converging, re-enters the magnet at the south pole. When the
magnetic induction flows through a piece of iron or other magnetizable
substance placed near the magnet, a south pole is
developed where the flux enters and a north pole where it
leaves the substance. Outside the magnet the direction of the
magnetic induction is generally the same as that of the magnetic
force. A map indicating the direction of the force in different
parts of the field due to a magnet may be constructed in a
very simple manner. A sheet of cardboard is placed above the
magnet, and some iron filings are sifted thinly and evenly over
the surface: if the cardboard is gently tapped, the filings will
arrange themselves in a series of curves, as shown in fig. 1.
<span class="img-floatright" style="text-align:center;background-color:transparent;color:inherit;width:248px;"><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/File:EB1911_-_Magnetism_-_Fig._1.jpg" class="mw-file-description"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/EB1911_-_Magnetism_-_Fig._1.jpg" decoding="async" width="248" height="233" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="248" data-file-height="233"></a></span><br><span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig</span>. 1.</span>
This experiment suggested to
Faraday the conception of
“lines of force,” of which the
curves formed by the filings
afford a rough indication;
Faraday’s lines are however
not confined to the plane of
the cardboard, but occur in
the whole of the space around
the magnet. A <i>line of force</i>
may be defined as an imaginary
line so drawn that its direction
at every point of its course
coincides with the direction of
the magnetic force at that
point. Through any point in the field one such line can be
drawn, but not more than one, for the force obviously cannot
have more than one direction; the lines therefore never
intersect. A line of force is regarded as proceeding from the
north pole towards the south pole of the magnet, its direction
being that in which an isolated north pole would be urged along <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="323" data-page-number="323" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 17.djvu/338" data-page-index="338" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_17.djvu/338"><span id="pageindex_338" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">​</span></span></span>
it. A south pole would be urged oppositely to the conventional
“direction” of the line; hence it follows that a very small
magnetic needle, if placed in the field, would tend to set itself
along or tangentially to the line of force passing through its
centre, as may be approximately verified if the compass be
placed among the filings on the cardboard. In the internal
field of a long coil of wire carrying an electric current, the lines
of force are, except near the ends, parallel to the axis of the
coil, and it is chiefly for this reason that the field due to a coil
is particularly well adapted for inductively magnetizing iron
and steel. The older operation of magnetizing a steel bar by
drawing a magnetic pole along it merely consists in exposing
successive portions of the bar to the action of the strong field
near the pole.
</p><p>Faraday’s lines not only show the direction of the magnetic
force, but also serve to indicate its magnitude or strength in
different parts of the field. Where the lines are crowded together,
as in the neighbourhood of the poles, the force is greater
(or the field is stronger) than where they are more widely
separated; hence the strength of a field at any point can be
accurately specified by reference to the concentration of the
lines. The lines presented to the eye by the scattered filings
are too vague and ill-defined to give a satisfactory indication
of the field-strength (see Faraday, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Experimental_researches_in_electricity" title="Experimental researches in electricity"><i>Experimental Researches</i></a>,
§ 3237) though they show its direction clearly enough. It is
however easy to demonstrate by means of the compass that the
force is much greater in some parts of the field than in others.
Lay the compass upon the cardboard, and observe the rate
at which its needle vibrates after being displaced from its
position of equilibrium; this will vary greatly in different
regions. When the compass is far from the magnet, the vibrations
will be comparatively slow; when it is near a pole, they
will be exceedingly rapid, the frequency of the vibrations
varying as the square root of the magnetic force at the spot.
In a refined form this method is often employed for measuring
the intensity of a magnetic field at a given place, just as the
intensity of gravity at different parts of the earth is deduced
from observations of the rate at which a pendulum of known
length vibrates.
</p><p>It is to the non-uniformity of the field surrounding a magnet
that the apparent attraction between a magnet and a magnetizable
body such as iron is ultimately due. This was pointed out
by W. Thomson (afterwards Lord Kelvin) in 1847, as the result
of a mathematical investigation undertaken to explain Faraday’s
experimental observations. If the inductively magnetized body
lies in a part of the field which happens to be uniform there will
be no resulting force tending to move the body, and it will not
be “attracted.” If however there is a small variation of the
force in the space occupied by the body, it can be shown that
the body will be urged, not necessarily towards a magnetic
pole, but <i>towards places of stronger magnetic force</i>. It will not
in general move along a line of force, as would an isolated pole,
but will follow the direction in which the magnetic force increases
most rapidly, and in so doing it may cross the lines of force
obliquely or even at right angles.
</p><p>If a magnetized needle were supported so that it could move
freely about its centre of gravity it would not generally settle
with its axis in a horizontal position, but would come to rest
with its north-seeking pole either higher or lower than its centre.
For the practical observation of this phenomenon it is usual to
employ a needle which can turn freely in the plane of the magnetic
meridian upon a horizontal axis passing through the centre
of gravity of the needle. The angle which the magnetic axis
makes with the plane of the horizon is called the <i>inclination</i> or
<i>dip</i>. Along an irregular line encircling the earth in the neighbourhood
of the geographical equator the needle takes up a
horizontal position, and the dip is zero. At places north of this
line, which is called the <i>magnetic equator</i>, the north end of the
needle points downwards, the inclination generally becoming
greater with increased distance from the equator. Within a
certain small area in the Arctic Circle (about 97° W. long., 70° N.
lat.) the north pole of the needle points vertically downwards,
the dip being 90°. South of the magnetic equator the south
end of the needle is always inclined downwards, and there is a
spot within the Antarctic Circle (148° E. long., 74° S. lat.) where
the needle again stands vertically, but with its north end directed
upwards. All these observations may be accounted for by the
fact first recognized by W. Gilbert in 1600, that the earth itself
is a great magnet, having its poles at the two places where the
dipping needle is vertical. To be consistent with the terminology
adopted in Britain, it is necessary to regard the pole which is
geographically north as being the south pole of the terrestrial
magnet, and that which is geographically south as the north
pole; in practice however the names assigned to the terrestrial
magnetic poles correspond with their geographical situations.
Within a limited space, such as that contained in a room, the
field due to the earth’s magnetism is sensibly uniform, the lines
of force being parallel straight lines inclined to the horizon at the
angle of dip, which at Greenwich in 1910 was about 67°. It is
by the horizontal component of the earth’s total force that the
compass-needle is directed.
</p><p>The magnets hitherto considered have been assumed to have
each two poles, the one north and the other south. It is possible
that there may be more than two. If, for example, a knitting
needle is stroked with the south pole of a magnet, the strokes
being directed from the middle of the needle towards the two
extremities alternately, the needle will acquire a north pole at
each end and a south pole in the middle. By suitably modifying
the manipulation a further number of <i>consequent poles</i>, as they
are called, may be developed. It is also possible that a magnet
may have no poles at all. Let a magnetic pole be drawn
several times around a uniform steel ring, so that every part
of the ring may be successively subjected to the magnetic force.
If the operation has been skilfully performed the ring will have
no poles and will not attract iron filings. Yet it will be magnetized;
for if it is cut through and the cut ends are drawn
apart, each end will be found to exhibit polarity. Again, a
steel wire through which an electric current has been passed
will be magnetized, but so long as it is free from stress it will
give no evidence of magnetization; if, however, the wire is
twisted, poles will be developed at the two ends, for reasons
which will be explained later. A wire or rod in this condition
is said to be <i>circularly magnetized</i>; it may be regarded as consisting
of an indefinite number of elementary ring-magnets,
having their axes coincident with the axis of the wire and their
planes at right angles to it. But no magnet can have a single
pole; if there is one, there must also be at least a second, of
the opposite sign and of exactly equal strength. Let a magnetized
knitting needle, having north and south poles at the
two ends respectively, be broken in the middle; each half
will be found to possess a north and a south pole, the appropriate
supplementary poles appearing at the broken ends. One of
the fragments may again be broken, and again two bipolar
magnets will be produced; and the operation may be repeated,
at least in imagination, till we arrive at molecular magnitudes
and can go no farther. This experiment proves that the condition
of magnetization is not confined to those parts where polar
phenomena are exhibited, but exists throughout the whole
body of the magnet; it also suggests the idea of <i>molecular</i>
<i>magnetism</i>, upon which the accepted theory of magnetization
is based. According to this theory the molecules of any magnetizable
substance are little permanent magnets the axes of
which are, under ordinary conditions, disposed in all possible
directions indifferently. The process of magnetization consists
in turning round the molecules by the application of magnetic
force, so that their north poles may all point more or less approximately
in the direction of the force; thus the body as a
whole becomes a magnet which is merely the resultant of an
immense number of molecular magnets.
</p><p>In every magnet the strength of the south pole is exactly
equal to that of the north pole, the action of the same magnetic
force upon the two poles being equal and oppositely directed.
This may be shown by means of the uniform field of force due
to the earth’s magnetism. A magnet attached to a cork and <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="324" data-page-number="324" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 17.djvu/339" data-page-index="339" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_17.djvu/339"><span id="pageindex_339" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">​</span></span></span>
floated upon water will set itself with its axis in the magnetic
meridian, but it will be drawn neither northward nor southward;
the forces acting upon the two poles have therefore no horizontal
resultant. And again if a piece of steel is weighed in a delicate
balance before and after magnetization, no change whatever in
its weight can be detected; there is consequently no upward or
downward resultant force due to magnetization; the contrary
parallel forces acting upon the poles of the magnet are equal,
constituting a couple, which may tend to turn the body, but not
to propel it.
</p><p>Iron and its alloys, including the various kinds of steel, though
exhibiting magnetic phenomena in a pre-eminent degree, are
not the only substances capable of magnetization. Nickel and
cobalt are also strongly magnetic, and in 1903 the interesting
discovery was made by F. Heusler that an alloy consisting of
copper, aluminium and manganese (Heusler’s alloy), possesses
magnetic qualities comparable with those of iron. Practically
the metals iron, nickel and cobalt, and some of their alloys and
compounds constitute a class by themselves and are called
<i>ferromagnetic</i> substances. But it was discovered by Faraday
in 1845 that all substances, including even gases, are either
attracted or repelled by a sufficiently powerful magnetic pole.
Those substances which are attracted, or rather which tend, like
iron, to move from weaker to stronger parts of the magnetic
field, are termed <i>paramagnetic</i>; those which are repelled, or tend
to move from stronger to weaker parts of the field, are termed
diamagnetic. Between the ferromagnetics and the paramagnetics
there is an enormous gap. The maximum magnetic
susceptibility of iron is half a million times greater than that of
liquid oxygen, one of the strongest paramagnetic substances
known. Bismuth, the strongest of the diamagnetics, has a
negative susceptibility which is numerically 20 times less than
that of liquid oxygen.
</p><p>Many of the physical properties of a metal are affected by
magnetization. The dimensions of a piece of iron, for example,
its elasticity, its thermo-electric power and its electric conductivity
are all changed under the influence of magnetism. On the
other hand, the magnetic properties of a substance are affected
by such causes as mechanical stress and changes of temperature.
An account of some of these effects will be found in another
section.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Magnetism#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
