(The example encyclopedia article is from 1911.)
Indigo, earlier <i>indico</i>, from Lat. <i>indicum</i>, the Indian substance
or dye, is one of
the most important and valuable of all dyestuffs. Until comparatively
recently it was obtained exclusively from the aqueous
extract of certain plants, principally of the genus <i>Indigofera</i>
which belongs to the natural order Leguminosae. Small
quantities are also obtained from <i>Lonchocarpus eyanescens</i>
(west coast of Africa), <i>Polygonum tintorium</i> (China) and the
woad plant <i>Isatis tinctoria</i>. The latter is of historical interest,
since up to the middle of the 17th century it was the only blue
dyestuff used by dyers in England and on the adjoining continent;
at the present time woad is still cultivated in Europe, but
serves merely as a ferment in the setting of the fermentation
indigo vat or so-called “woad vat” used in wool dyeing.
</p><p>The bulk of the natural indigo which is brought into the
market comes from India, while smaller quantities are imported
from Java, Guatemala and other places. The plant from which
indigo is made in Bengal is the <i>Indigofera sumatrana</i>, which is
reared from seed sown about the end of April or the beginning
of March. By the middle of June the plant has attained a
height of from 3 to 5 ft., and it is at this period that the first
manufacturing begins, a second crop being obtained in August.
The indigo is contained in the leaf of the plant in the form of
a colourless glucoside, known as indican, C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>17</sub>O<sub>6</sub>N·3H<sub>2</sub>O.
This substance is soluble in water and by the joint action of
an enzyme, contained in the leaf, and atmospheric oxygen it
yields indigotine, the colouring matter of indigo. It is on these
facts that the manufacturing of indigo from the plant is based.
</p><p>The plant is cut early in the morning and transported to the
factory in bullock carts. Here it is steeped in water in steeping
vats having a capacity of about 1000 cub. ft. for periods varying,
according to circumstances, from nine to fourteen hours, when
the liquid—the colour of which varies from a bright orange to
an olive green—is run into the beating vats which lie at a lower
level. The beating, the object of which is to bring the liquor
as freely as possible into contact with the air, was formerly
done by striking the surface with bamboo sticks, but is now
effected either by means of a paddle wheel or by forcing a current
of air from a steam blower or a compressor through the liquid.
When the beating is finished, the precipitated indigo is allowed
to settle, the supernatant liquid being drawn off and run to
waste. The indigo mud thus obtained, which is known as mal,
is strained, boiled for a short period for the purpose of sterilizing,
formed into bars, cut into blocks of about 3 in. cube and dried.<sup id="cite_ref-f1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Indigo#cite_note-f1-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
The actual amount of colouring matter yielded by the leaf is
but small, averaging, according to Ch. Rawson, 0.5%, but the
yield from the whole plant is considerably less, since the stalks
and twigs contain practically no colour.
</p><p>Since the introduction on a large scale of synthetic indigo
efforts have been made in India and in Java to place the cultivation
of the plant and the manufacture of the natural product
on a more scientific basis. But although many important
improvements have been achieved from the agricultural as well
as from the manufacturing point of view, resulting no doubt
in the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from retension">retention</span> of a portion of the industry, the synthetic
product has gained the upper hand and is likely to retain it.
</p><p>Natural indigoes vary considerably in composition, containing
in some qualities as much as 90% and in others as little as 20%
of colouring matter. The blue colouring matter which indigo
contains is known as indigotine, but there are usually also present
in small quantities other colouring matters such as indigo red
or indirubrine, a yellow colour known as kaempferol, indigo
green and indigo brown, as well as indigo gluten and more or
less mineral matter.
</p><p>The bulk of the indigo which now comes into the European
market is prepared synthetically from coal tar. The following
figures indicate the values of the imports into England of
natural and synthetic indigo, and are taken from the official
Board of Trade returns:—

<p>During the period 1899–1908, the average price of indigo had
declined from a fraction under 3s. to about 2s. 2<span class="sfrac">⁠<span class="tion" style="font-size:61%;"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">2</span></span>⁠</span>d. per ℔. At
first sight it might appear that the use of indigo in England
was rapidly declining, but this does not necessarily follow when
it is borne in mind that London was formerly the distributing
centre of natural indigo for the continent and America.

<p><i>Chemistry.</i>—Our knowledge of the chemistry of indigo is largely
derived from the classical researches of A. von Baeyer and his
collaborators. In 1841 Erdmann and Laurent observed that on
oxidation indigo yielded isatin; and in 1848 Fritzsche obtained
aniline by distilling the dyestuff with potash. In 1870 A. v. Baeyer
and Knop succeeded in preparing indigotine by heating isatin with
phosphorus trichloride, acetyl chloride and phosphorus. In the
same year, C. Engler and A. Emmerling obtained small quantities of
the dyestuff by heating nitroacetophenone with soda-lime and zinc
dust, while in 1875 M. v. Nencki prepared it by the oxidation of
indol by ozone. Indol had been previously obtained from albuminoids
by means of the pancreas ferment. It was not, however, until
1880 that v. Baeyer, who had been at work on the subject since 1865,
was able to obtain indigotine from more or less easily accessible coal
tar derivatives of known constitution. The most important of these
synthetic processes due to the researches of v. Baeyer was the production
of the dyestuff from ortho-nitrophenylpropiolic acid (see
Propiolic Acid), which yields indigotine on being treated with
caustic soda and a reducing agent such as grape sugar or xanthate of
soda. Although used in small quantities in calico printing, it never
attained any commercial importance as a means of producing indigo,
the cost of production being far too high.
</p><p>Many synthetic processes of preparing indigotine have since been
devised, but the one which stands out pre-eminently from a technical
point of view and the one which ultimately led to the commercial
success of the synthetic product is that of Heumann who showed in
1890 that indigotine can be prepared by melting phenylglycocoll

The
yield was at first very unsatisfactory. It was subsequently found,
however, that by starting with phenylglycocoll-ortho-carboxylic
acid, the yield was sufficiently good to render the process a practical
success. The starting-point for the manufacture of synthetic
indigo is naphthalene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, which is oxidized, by heating with
concentrated sulphuric acid in the presence of a little mercury, to
phthalic anhydride, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>O, which is then converted into
ortho-aminobenzoic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>H), by treatment with an
alkaline hypochlorite. This acid is then condensed with monochloracetic
acid to form phenylglycocoll-ortho-carboxylic acid,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH·CH<sub>2</sub>·CO<sub>2</sub>H)(CO<sub>2</sub>H), which on being melted with caustic
alkali yields indoxylic acid,

By alkaline oxidation indoxyl is converted into indigotine.
</p><p>The patent literature of processes for bringing about the conversion
of the phenylglycine or its carboxylic acid into indoxylic acid,
indoxyl and indigotine is enormous; a circumstance due to the fact
that the efficiency of this operation controls the price of the synthetic
dyestuff. Caustic soda has been practically given up, being replaced
partly or wholly by caustic potash; in addition, alkaline earths,
sodamide, nitrides, alkali carbides, &amp;c., have been used. In 1906,
Meister, Lucius and Brüning patented the addition of lead and
sodium to a mixture of caustic potash and soda; the Basler
Chemische Fabrik use a mixture of caustic potash and soda at 210°-260°;
Léon Lilienfeld added slaked lime or magnesia to the fused
alkali, with a subsequent heating in a current of ammonia at 150°-300°,
and in 1908 patented a process wherein the melt is heated
under greatly reduced pressure; this gave a yield of 80-90%.

<p>It can be prepared in an almost pure state by extracting good
qualities of Bengal or Java indigo or synthetic indigo with boiling
nitrobenzene, from which it crystallizes on cooling in dark blue
crystals having a metallic sheen. When heated in an open vessel it
readily volatilizes, yielding a violet vapour which condenses on
cooling in the form of crystals. Indigotine is also soluble in boiling
aniline oil, quinoline, glacial acetic acid and chloroform, but is
insoluble in water, dilute acids and alkalis and ordinary solvents like
alcohol, ether, &amp;c. By nitric acid and many other oxidizing agents
it is readily converted into isatin, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Heated with concentrated
sulphuric acid it yields a disulphonic acid, C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>,
the sodium salt of which finds application as an acid colour in wool
dyeing under the name of Indigo carmine.<sup id="cite_ref-f2_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Indigo#cite_note-f2-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> By the action of reducing
agents, indigotine is converted into <i>indigo white</i>, C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
which is readily soluble in alkalis or milk of lime with a yellow colour.
On exposing the alkaline solution to the air the indigo white is
rapidly oxidized back to indigotine, and on these two reactions the
application of indigo in dyeing and printing is based. (See <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Dyeing" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Dyeing">Dyeing</a></span>

</p><p>Various halogen (chlorine and bromine) substitutive derivatives of
indigotine have been introduced which, while not differing essentially
from ordinary indigo in their properties, produce for the most part
redder shades in dyeing. They are claimed to be faster and brighter
colours. It has been shown by Friedländer (Ber., 1909, 42, p. 765)
that the reddish violet colouring matter obtained from the colour-yielding
glands of the mollusc <i>Murex brandaris</i>, by means of which
the famous Tyrian purple of the ancients was dyed, is a dibromindigo,
C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>8</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A new departure in the synthetic dyestuffs belonging
to the indigo group was inaugurated by the discovery in 1906
by P. Friedländer of thioindigo red, a derivative of thionaphthen,
which is formed from phenylthioglycol-ortho-carboxylic acid,
